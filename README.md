# BST: Bun, Sass, TSX

The BST stack is a front-end helper that uses Sass as the CSS preprocessor, and TSX as the front-end language.

This tool is perfect for developers who want to build web applications with a modern, efficient, and easy-to-use stack.

See the example directory for a minimal example of how to use the BST stack.
